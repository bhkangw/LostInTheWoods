## Synopsis
Lost In the Woods is a web app that showcases various hiking trails and allows users to post their own favorites. I built this project using C# and ASP.NET Core framework.

## Direct Goals
1. Use my newly learned knowledge of Dapper ORM to map the db models with MySQL.
2. Create a useful service for hiking enthusiasts.
3. Practice integrating useful APIs to my web apps.
4. Develope my skills in C# and ASP.NET Core.

## Features
- Uses Google Maps API to display hiking locations.
- Form validations screen incoming data prior to entering database.
- Connects to MySQL database via Entity ORM.
- Used Twitter Bootstrap for basic styling.
- Secure connection strings using dependency injection.
